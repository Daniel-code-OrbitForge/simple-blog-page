		"body": "Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is designed for building web applications and APIs, and it is known for its simplicity, performance, and scalability. Express allows developers to create server-side applications quickly and easily by providing a set of middleware functions that can be used to handle HTTP requests and responses. It also supports routing, templating engines, and various other features that make it a popular choice for building web applications with Node.js.",

		"body": "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient. It also has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Express.js, that simplify the development process.",

		"body": "Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express involves creating a server that can handle HTTP requests and responses. Express provides a simple and intuitive way to define routes and middleware for your API. You can use various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with your API endpoints. Additionally, you can use middleware to handle tasks such as authentication, validation, and error handling.",

		"body": "Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. It can perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, and error handling. Middleware functions can be added to the request handling pipeline using the app.use() method.",

		"body": "Error handling in Express.js is a crucial aspect of building robust applications. Express provides a built-in error handling middleware that can be used to catch and process errors that occur during the request-response cycle. You can define custom error handling middleware by adding a middleware function with four arguments: (err, req, res, next). This function can be used to log the error, send an error response to the client, or perform any other error handling logic.",
